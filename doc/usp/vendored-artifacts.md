# Vendored USP Artifacts

Files in this repo that are built or generated from `linksys/usp_framework` and checked in as-is. This is the single source of truth for their upstream origin and current version.

**Not the only vendored artifacts.** `web/assets/canvaskit.{js,wasm}` are also hand-copied and committed, from the pinned Flutter SDK rather than from `usp_framework`. They have their own manifest and update procedure in `doc/web/vendored-canvaskit.md`. They were missing from every manifest in the repo until #1316, which is how a 3.44.0 CanvasKit survived CI's move to 3.47.0 unnoticed.

## Upstream

- **Local path**: `linksys/usp/usp_framework/`
- **Repo**: `github.com/linksys/usp_framework`

## Manifest

**Last updated**: 2026-08-05

The web package records reviewed `usp_framework` commit
`344a1757f97bcc8643b05322027aafd7053856cd` (merged `main`, PR #45
WebSocket readiness) and was built with both the
`wasm` and `websocket` features. Machine-verifiable local hashes and the
reviewed upstream paths are recorded in `web/usp-artifacts.json`. Consumer CI
does not authenticate the cross-repository commit reference; the producer
repository owns the source-to-committed-package rebuild gate.

The generated TypeScript surface includes `UspClient.subscribe()` and
`unsubscribe()`, but PrivacyGUI intentionally does not bind those methods.
Application subscriptions go through the authenticated `UspBridgeClient` and
SSE lifecycle instead. `tools/usp_boundary/policy.json` records that decision
and fails if either the upstream method or the consumer policy disappears
without review.

| # | Artifact | Version | Checked-in path | Upstream source |
|---|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `usp-codegen` (Mach-O arm64) | **0.16.0** | `tools/usp-codegen` | `usp-codegen/bin/usp-codegen` (built from `src/` via `Makefile.standalone`) |
| 2 | `usp_client.js` | **0.12.0** | `web/usp_client.js` | `usp-client/pkg/usp_client.js` |
| 3 | `usp_client_bg.wasm` | **0.12.0** | `web/usp_client_bg.wasm` | `usp-client/pkg/usp_client_bg.wasm` |
| 4 | `usp_client.d.ts` | **0.12.0** | `web/usp_client.d.ts` | `usp-client/pkg/usp_client.d.ts` |

## Derived (generated locally, not copied)

`lib/generated/*.g.dart` is produced on this machine by running `tools/usp-codegen` against `usp_framework/usp-definitions/`. Its output is a function of:
- the codegen binary version above, and
- the YAML snapshot in `usp_framework/usp-definitions/` at generation time.

The YAML definitions are **not vendored** into this repo, so the snapshot has to be recorded here or it is unrecoverable — nothing in the generated output carries its source commit.

**Definitions snapshot**: `usp_framework` `6e732f8` (merged `main`, 2026-09-16 — `linksys/usp_framework#64`, `#65` and `#66`). Regenerated under it in PrivacyGUI #1572: `lib/generated/firmware_auto_update.g.dart` (four new read-only firmware diagnostics leaves, from `linksys/usp_framework#66`) and `lib/generated/system_info.g.dart` (`X_LINKSYS_BaseMACAddress`, from `linksys/usp_framework#65`). **`lib/generated/wan_settings.g.dart` is deliberately a revision behind**: `linksys/usp_framework#64` adds `X_LINKSYS_MTUMode` and removes the PPP credential leaves from that definition, and picking it up belongs to #757, which owns the MTU-mode work. So a full-tree regeneration at this pin is a no-op outside those two files plus that one — anyone who regenerates for any reason will pick `linksys/usp_framework#64` up, which #757 wants and has the analysis for.

The previous snapshot was `b041809728a63cb1801dda4b58ed5bcf221d14e4` (merged `main`, `linksys/usp_framework#63`, 2026-09-14), which contained `linksys/usp_framework#57` (`eecf2699`) re-aligning the DataElements definitions to the FL-WRT 2.0 / prplMesh schema; the last commit touching either DataElements YAML is `ea7c8510` (2026-09-10). Regenerated under it in PrivacyGUI #1555: `lib/generated/data_elements_network.g.dart` and the new `data_elements_network_info.g.dart`.

Generating from the `origin` fork instead of `upstream` at this pin silently reproduces the bug #1555 fixed: the fork's `data_elements_network.yaml` is the 2026-08-05 revision and it has no `data_elements_network_info.yaml`.

## Update procedure

1. **Codegen binary**
   ```bash
   cd linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-codegen
   make -f Makefile.standalone clean all
   cp bin/usp-codegen linksys/PrivacyGUI/tools/usp-codegen
   linksys/PrivacyGUI/tools/usp-codegen --version  # verify
   ```

2. **Regenerate `.g.dart`** (bypasses the known `--local` bug in `tools/usp-codegen.sh`, see `doc/usp/issues/usp-codegen-script-issue.md`)
   ```bash
   cd linksys/PrivacyGUI
   ./tools/usp-codegen \
     --definitions-dir linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-definitions \
     --output-dir lib/generated \
     --language dart \
     --client-import 'package:privacy_gui/core/usp/services/usp_client.dart' \
     --client-class 'UspClient'
   fvm dart format lib/generated
   ```
   Record the definitions commit you generated from in the **Definitions
   snapshot** line above, in the same commit as the regenerated files.

   Run the format **from the repo root**, on `lib/generated` — not on a temp
   output directory. The style is decided by this package's language version
   (`pubspec.yaml` pins `sdk: ">=3.3.0 <4.0.0"`, below 3.7), so formatting in
   place is a no-op on untouched files; formatting a temp directory resolves to
   the newest language version, switches to the 3.7 "tall" style, and turns a
   3-file change into a 46-file diff of pure noise.

3. **Web client assets**
   ```bash
   cd linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-client
   wasm-pack build --release --target web --out-dir pkg --features wasm,websocket
   cd -
   cp linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-client/pkg/usp_client.js      web/usp_client.js
   cp linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-client/pkg/usp_client_bg.wasm web/usp_client_bg.wasm
   cp linksys/usp/usp_framework/usp-client/pkg/usp_client.d.ts    web/usp_client.d.ts
   ```

4. **Update `web/usp-artifacts.json` and the version table above** in the same
   commit as the artifact change. Use the full upstream commit SHA and hashes
   from the producer artifact.

5. **Sanity checks**
   - `python3 tools/usp_boundary/verify_artifacts.py --manifest web/usp-artifacts.json --root .`
   - `python3 tools/usp_boundary/check_boundary.py --help`
   - `flutter analyze lib/generated` — no new errors
   - `flutter analyze lib/page lib/core` — no new errors
   - Grep for removed APIs when bumping `usp-client` (e.g. `setOrderedWithOptions` was removed in 0.9.0)
