    - action: "Execute Wi-Fi tests based on the number of active bands (now all should be active), assuming a no-LAN-port safety configuration."
      meta_steps:
        - step: "If more than one band is active, select one (e.g., '2.4GHz') and perform a toggle-off-then-on test, handling all dialogs."
          verify: "The selected band's switch successfully toggles off and then on again."
